marp <presentation>.md --html -o <presentation>.pdf --allow-local-files
```

## September 06 Presentation

This uses `marp` to transpile the markdown to an HTML file
that allows a browser presentation rather than a pdf.

```
will generate a `Presentation_0906.html` file that you can just put into your browser.

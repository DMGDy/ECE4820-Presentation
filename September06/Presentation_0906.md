## Project Overview

### Claims Investigation Committee (CIC) Multi-Input Test Device

#### Goal
- Develop a multi-input test device for the **Claims Investigation Committee (CIC)** to test various automotive sensors, modules, and components.

#### Objectives
- Develop a web-based front-end for the test device
- Implement a communication layer for real-time data transfer
- Design and build a test device core for sensor testing
- Create a custom embedded Linux image for the test device
- Integrate multiple signal testing capabilities (PWM, Voltage, CAN)
- Implement a database system for storing and retrieving test results

#### Features
- Web Assembly Front End for test control and result display
- Real-time data transfer
- Custom Embedded Linux
- Multiple signal testing capabilities: PWM, Voltage, CAN
- Database system for storing and retrieving test results
- Provide pass/fail feedback for each test

#### Purpose
- Support new electric-pneumatic hybrid braking system produced by **ZF Group** launching January 2025 by **Daimler AG**
- Streamline the claims investigation process
- Reduce time and cost associated with field claim evaluations
- Improve accuracy in identifying faulty components
- Enable efficient troubleshooting and root cause analysis
- Facilitate data-driven decision making for product improvements
